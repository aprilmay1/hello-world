# hello-world
having a go at hello world, learning new things every day!
Hi there - I've always had an interest in coding, but never really "saw" it as something I could take forward. Now I'm a bit behind the times, but would really like to learn more. 
So here I go making a start. I cross my fingers that I'll continue :-)
